Mini Bootstrap (Custom SCSS Framework)

📌 Project Overview

This project is a lightweight CSS framework inspired by Bootstrap, built using SASS/SCSS to generate CSS. It provides a responsive grid system, customizable buttons, alerts, tooltips, modals, and more—all designed for flexibility and ease of use.

🚀 Features

1️⃣ Responsive Grid System

.container and .container-fluid for layout structure.

.row to create flex-based rows.

.col-- classes for responsive columns at different breakpoints.

2️⃣ Buttons

Custom button styles using .btn-* classes.

Different sizes: .btn-lg, .btn-sm.

Disabled state with .disabled.

3️⃣ Alerts

.alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger.

Customizable styles for notifications.

4️⃣ Tooltips

Custom tooltips using the title attribute and data-placement (top, bottom, left, right).

5️⃣ Modals (Popins)

Simple modal system with .modal class.

Supports opening and closing via JavaScript.

Closes on Escape, clicking outside, or .popin-dismiss button.

6️⃣ Tabs & Nested Tabs

Dynamic tab system with .tab-list and .tab-content.

Supports nested tabs.

🎯 How It Works

All SCSS files are modular and compiled into main.css.

JavaScript handles interactive components (modals, tabs, tooltips).

Fully responsive with CSS flexbox & media queries.

💡 Future Improvements

Add more utility classes.

Implement dark mode support.

Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes for tooltips and modals).
